    <p>His current work with the Emerging Technologies Program in the utility industry  for San Diego Gas & Electric (previously for Pacific Gas & Electric) consists of identifying, assessing and validating electric energy emerging technologies. Instead of focusing on just the technologies, his unique approach of engaging customers created excitement and enthusiasm for participation in the projects ensuring their completion.  He has completed a major energy efficiency study for Travelers which included completion of multiple projects in the Travelers 's Hartford Tower Building. The 30+ projects recommended by Daryl DeJean and Lee Stevens has gained them another point in ENERGY STAR with their high score going up from 96 to 97 in 2010. With the help of Emerging Technologies Associates, Travelers received two additional ENERGY STAR on their Claim University and Fall River buildings. Claim University has begun lighting retrofits that can now be benchmarked in their Portfolio Manager that ETA trained their Facility team on how to use from soups to nuts. The CBRE facility on site is now able to submit for the labels with proper data being entered. Please  refer to 11/28/2010, update on Travelers section of this website for further details.</p>
    
    <p>Daryl DeJean continues to share knowledge with energy management consultants, directors of facilities, Facilities managers and utlitiy managers on the features and benefits of the ENERGY STAR program. ETA has assisted in benchmarking over 12 million feet of San Diego Gas & Electric customers through a series of seminars conducted by ETA since July 31, 2010. The response to Daryl's practical and  cost effective and long lasting approach  to energy management continues to receive rave reviews from all audiences on both Coasts of the US. Daryl continues to engage everyone with the implementation steps necessary to achieve efficiency by sharing measures that he implemented in the 200 facilities that he managed for HILTI. The facilities included computer data centers, cafeteria and plants, buildings that have challenging high intensity energy use.</p>
    
    <p>The Clean Tech San Diego group  published on 11/23/2010 the highlights of  Daryl's ENERGY STAR's Best Practices seminar as a way to communicate the simple approach to energy management that Daryl has taught at the California Center for Sustainable Energy (CCSE) on behalf of San Diego Gas & Electric.

    <p>The assessment reports resulting from the emerging technologies projects he has managed  are publicly listed in the Projects tab of this website; they are published and available on the California Emerging Technologies Coordinating Council website (ETCC) (<a href="http://www.etcc-ca.com/" target="_blank">http://www.etcc-ca.com/</a>). These assessment reports are used as a frame of reference by many organizations and companies for assessing new technologies. His work with one of his clients is best described by a Senior Program Manager. Please see the attached letter: <a href="/pdf/Thor_Scordelis_PGE_testimonial.pdf" target="_blank">Thor Scordelis PGE testimonial</a></p>
    
    <p>As a project manager, he enjoyed control technologies projects where he is able to assist his clients with defined clear and simple control strategies. In 2008, he managed the hotel guest room DDC control technology assessment for San Diego Gas & Electric at four hotels located in San Diego for 18 months. He coordinated the installation , M&V  production of the report for this project. The report for this assessment is published.  He is working on several lighting control systems that will be published later this year. In addition, Daryl is working with a  San Diego-based wireless consulting firm on integrating the simplest wireless communication architecture with the best in class sensors and ballast technologies to achieve long lasting savings while delivering troubleshooting savings that typically occurs with such systems.  </p>
    
    <p>As an active member of several U.S. Department of Energy Solid State Lighting Committees, Daryl was selected to serve as a panel member to review the U. S. Department of Energy Solid State Lighting Commercialization Initiative in 2009. In that capacity, he stressed the crucial importance of customer expectations and acceptance in the technological development of new LED products.</p>
    
    <p>Believing that the establishment of global sustainability standards are important, he joined ASTM as a volunteer voting member of the E-60 Subcommittee on Sustainability. His passion for emerging energy efficiency technologies led him to seek a formal forum for standards setting. Daryl believes that without standards of performance whether it is function, design, sustainability or financial return, any emerging technology in the energy efficiency field  will not produce sustainable energy or economic savings. He has been an active voting member alongside many different stakeholders ranging from Fortune 500 companies to Non Profit Organizations who have a vision of a lesser carbon world.</p>
    
    <p>Daryl is a strong believer that the first and foremost step in reducing greenhouse gases is to uncover breakthrough technologies in energy efficiency that accelerate and enhance sustainability. He is a strong advocate of the energy plan adopted by  California which established a “loading order” of preferred resources. This plan places energy efficiency as the state’s top-priority procurement resource, and sets aggressive long-term goals for energy efficiency and achieve greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. He has developed many can do leadership training  programs that has empowered facilities management teams to receive recognition for their tremendous accomplishments and to allow them to continue to gain productivity. This all started at HILTI when Daryl integrated Datastream with the energy management system in place to allow for projects to be tracked from a work order to completion of tasks: Datastream asked Daryl to speak at their Annual User Conference one year to show their clients the possibilities.</p>
    
    <p>He has adopted Ernst von Weizsäcker's vision of a global resource productivity that has driven the German economy to the sustainable wealth that it has achieved over the last 20 years. Factor Five teachings were incorporated in Dary's knowledge of facility management, utility industry , strategic management solutions to drive changes in behavior across all of the clients that ETA works with. Some of the key studies that are at the backbone of the firm's work are available at the following links:</p>
    
    <p>As a founding member of the California Advanced Lighting Control Program, Daryl DeJean has been instrumental in working with NECA-IBEW and its partners on creating a nationally recognized Green Workforce Training Program that is not only creating green jobs but ensures that energy efficiency projects deliver persistent savings for many years: the proper selection of the systems whether lighting, building envelope or HVAC is a crucial decision. Equally important is the proper installation of the systems by certified contractors who have participated in hands on labs where they are the ABC's of new communication interfaces as well as electrical circuitry and lighting technoligies. By failing to specify certified contractors, many energy efficiency projects sponsors have seen lowered energy efficiency achieved than stated in manufacturers 's specifications and training.</p>
    
    <p>In April 2009, Daryl DeJean  and Lee Stevens participated in the Workshop Toward Product Standards for Sustainability organized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) with the support of the US EPA. The workshop brought together 340 stakeholders representing standard developing organizations, consortia, industry, government and consumer groups to focus on issues related to sustainability and environmental performance standards for products. For a copy of the Final Report from the Workshop, you can click on the following link, <a href="http://www.ansi.org/meetings_events/events/sustainable_products_standards_workshop.aspx?menuid=8" target="_blank">ANSI Workshop Toward Product Standards for Sustainability April 8-9, 2009</a> . With today's consumers shopping with sustainability in mind, the concepts of green and socially responsible being subject to many interpretations. " Government, industry and consumers are all looking for product standards and criteria to help establish uniform technical requirements, methods, processes, and practices that address sustainability" according to ANSI. The Workshop brought together stakeholders to share insight into the market drivers and identify key gaps and define the roles of  product standards in sustainability.</p>
    
    <p>The workshop offered a neutral venue where all interested stakeholders can engage in discussions that will support and facilitate the timely development, promulgation, and use of standards to address sustainability issues related to products. 240 individuals attended in person during the two-day workshop, and nearly 100 more participated by teleconference and webinar. ASTM International and ANSI collaborates on such global standards setting initiatives.</p>
    
    <p>As Director of Facilities and Energy for Hilti, Daryl's ability to evaluate and demonstrate that project benefits and return on investment extended beyond energy savings into other areas such as improvements in employee comfort and productivity or corporate image resulted in obtaining the executive buy in on energy efficiency projects. Under Daryl's leadership, energy management was integrated into the organization's structure as part of its core business. The productivity gains came from improved manufacturing process and better working conditions. In addition, Daryl led several cultural changes that resulted in phenomenal productivity gains throughout the Company. He also created several collaborative teams to ensure adoption and acceptance of changes. Ms. Rosalia C. Cunningham, M.A., PHR, Director, Organizational Development/Chief Spirit Sherpa for Hilti, Inc. best describes Daryl  as follows:</p>
    
    <p>"Daryl's keen vision was evident when he successfully led change efforts by creating a new culture within his team, Facilities and Administrative Operations, by redefining and reassigning roles and responsibilities that led to operational efficiency, effectiveness, and excellence while improving profitability and resource productivity. He didn't stop there, as he also renamed his department which created a departmental brand."</p>
