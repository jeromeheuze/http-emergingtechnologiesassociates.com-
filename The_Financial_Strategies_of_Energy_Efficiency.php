    <p>Reaping the benefits of an energy management strategy requires taking full advantage of cash flow, productivity gains and other non-energy benefits across departments, facilities and business units. By deriving a lower blended cost of capital for our clients, we help them achieve their expected return on equity, return on assets and profitability goals. We strongly believe that meeting the key profitability and hurdle rates expected by the finance team is crucial in gaining acceptance and adoption of energy efficiency strategies.</p>

    <li>Determine how energy affects the bottom line</li>
    <li>Establish the link between energy and shareholder equity</li>
    <li>Control financial risk of energy consumption</li>
    <li>Simplify financial disclosure and reporting of carbon exposure</li>
    <li>Quantify increased productivity and sales</li>
