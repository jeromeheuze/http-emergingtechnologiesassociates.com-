    <p>We are committed to enhancing resource productivity through targeted strategies for our clients.</p>
    <p>We advise our clients in discovering untapped energy efficiency productivity gains within their organizations or corporations before investing in costly measures and creating unique opportunities for financial and carbon savings.</p>
    <p>Our ultimate goal is to make it easier for large organizations with 200 buildings or more and global strategic management teams to adopt the best practices and in class technologies with profitability as the number one goal.</p>
    
    </div>
    
    <p>We start with our goal to maximize the resource productivity of any enterprise and develop a long term survival plan that incorporates energy as a critical resource. We have adopted the strategies shared by  world famous Professor Ernst von Weizsäcker who is co-Chair of the  International Panel on Sustainable Resource Management. Professor  von Weizsäcker is the lead author of Factor Five, a strategic guide and roadmap to resource productivity (<a href="http://www.earthscan.co.uk/?tabid=92742" target="_blank">http://www.earthscan.co.uk/?tabid=92742</a>). Professor von Weizsäcker was instrumental in helping the German government craft the national energy policy that is a model for the entire globe and drove the productivity of the German economy to its current sustainable wealth. He continues his work with many nations at the UN.</p>
    
    <p>We further believe that full scale adoption of energy management strategies across our nation will fuel increased productivity gains as never seen before creating a competitive advantage for our nation in global markets. We have aligned ourselves with Fortune 500 companies in strategic allances to develop scalable and affordable solutions to allow for projects to occur within a large enterprises budget over several years. We have assisted several large organizations in implementing the measures internally retaining green jobs and green managers on their payroll and empowering entire teams learn and pave the way for others.</p>
    
    <p>We incorporate many behavioral studies that are the backbone of energy management program whether at a State level or nationally and work down to the level of the enterprise. Our belief is that market strategies is a driving force behind every enterprise's successful marketing of their products and services, whether private or public. </p>

    <p>Our office is 99% lit with LED and compact fluorescent lamps.Our landscaping is on an low flow irrigation system and our plants are made up of drought-tolerant plants. We use coffee bean to fertilize our plants reducing the amount of fertilizers leaking into the sewer system and ultimately the ocean.</p>

    <p>We car-pool by train, subway and other public transportation to all projects whenever possible. We select airline carriers who operate fuel efficient fleet.When in town, we jog or walk to the stores. Our transportation expenses are less than half of last year as we have further enforced transportation-saving measures.<br />Check out the tool for your own footprint!<br /><a href="http://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx" target="_blank">US EP:A/US DOE Carbon Footprint Calculator</a></p>

    <p>We only use paper goods with high recycled contents and experimenting with bags made of compostable material.<br />We try to use mild chemicals such as fruit based natural chemicals to minimize the disposal of toxic chemicals in the wastewater stream. Our food source is a primarily locally grown produce and we are seeking locally sourced meats and other food stuff from our local vendors.</p>

    <p>We have completed the ENERGY STAR Challenge and will continue to increase our 12 million or more sqft benchmarking and energy efficiency measures. Our goal was 1 million sqft for this year! We have exceeded that goal multi-fold. Please refer to our ENERGY STAR page on this site for more details.<br />Please ask us about ways to make a difference as an individual!</p>
