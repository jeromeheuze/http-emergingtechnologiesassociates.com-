	<p>ICE II Cold Storage is a state of the art warehouse where cutting edge energy efficiency technologies and solar power were combined to achieve a 75% reduction in power consumption over a typical warehouse. The design of the building was the culmination of many years of development for Hamann Construction.</p>
    <p>The LEDs installed in the warehouse contributed to the LEED certification energy efficiency points required by U.S. Green Building Council. The design of the building was the culmination of many years of research and development for Hamann Construction in integration of several high efficiency systems with solar power. Please see Environmental Leader link for further details:</p>
