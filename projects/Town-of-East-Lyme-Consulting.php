	<p>One of the challenges facing the town is the high level of maintenance that the existing elegant lighting fixtures necessitate. During a pre-assessment visit, ETA identified the needs of the city in each part of the building and reviewed lighting levels needed by the various occupants of the Center and their varied needs. The Library and  Senior Center exemplified the differing needs within the building.</p>   
    <p>The following tasks were completed:</p>
    <ol class="ollist">
    <li>review street lighting options</li>
    <li>prepared photometric layout</li>
    <li>identified potential manufacturers</li>
    <li>economic and rate analysis</li>
    <li>assist in preparation of the specifications for bid package.In addition, the town consulted on the selection of a high efficiency boiler for the High School.</li>
