	<p>In June 2008, Emerging Technologies Associates (ETA) was retained by Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric, the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA), the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and the California Community College System to create part of the Business Section for a new statewide training course on Advanced Lighting Control Systems.</p>
    <p>This course is part of a statewide workforce development initiative to create a certfication process that will ensure persistent energy savings as a result of the proper installation and commissioning of advanced lighting control systems.</p>
    <p>ETA created the Market Drivers and Financing Projects modules for the course and is conducting four Train the Trainer sessions for selected participants of the program. In addition, Emerging Technologies Associates screened and selected financial institutions and other financial service providers for the initiative to finance energy efficiency projects resulting from the CALCTP Initiative.</p>
