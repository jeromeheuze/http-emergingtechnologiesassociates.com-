	<p>ETA was retained by a Sharp HealthCare to review existing ENERGY STAR benchmarking of three of its hospitals. With three hospitals occupying over two million in square footage, the hospital group had begun many energy efficiency measures for several years and was looking for ways to save more energy with a limited budget.</p>   
    <p>Lee Stevens and Daryl DeJean verified all three hospitals 's energy performance profile and validated the accuracy of the physical and operating characteristics within ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager.</p>
    <p>One of the hospitals Sharp Chula Vista received their ENERGY STAR in 2009 with ETA's help, after trying for over six months.</p>
    <p>The other hospitals are seeing major progress as they are able to better account for changes in energy performance from a baseline that meets the ENERGY STAR benchmarking methodology. The other two hospitals are continuing to benchmark monthly and track their energy performance as new energy efficiency measures are implemented.  ETA is continuing to work with Sharp HealthCare on the ENERGY STAR Energy Management Program and development of strategies related thereto.</p>
