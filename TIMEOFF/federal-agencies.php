    <p>As a member of the Federal Government, you have successfully implemented many sustainability measures. Why not join other Government Agencies in meeting the Green.Gov Challenge?</p>

    <p>We have worked with the Department of Veterans Affairs in VISN 22 on following projects:</p>
    <h4>1. High Performance Building Labeling</h4>
    <p>We have assisted the San Diego VA Medical Center in obtaining one out of two 2010 ENERGY STAR Hospital labels in California.  This is an exemplary accomplishment for the Medical Center Energy team for the approx. 1 million sqft hospital in spite of very high occupancy and increasing use of medical technologies. The Medical Center received the 2011 ENERGY STAR. We have shared the ENERGY STAR's new Federal Guiding Principles Checklist with the Energy Management team to allow for reporting of the hospital's energy performance to VA Headquarters.</p>
    
    <h4>2. Assessment of Advanced Control Systems</h4>
    <p>From 2009 to 2010, ETA managed and completed an advanced control system assessment as part of the Partnership between San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) and San Diego VA Medical Center. The purpose was to allow SDG&E and the VA hospital to determine whether the system can be deployed in a statewide control application.</p>
    <p>The report is published on the Emerging Technologies Coordinating Council website at www.etcc-ca.gov

    <h4>3. Knowledge Transfer of High Efficiency Technologies</h4>
    <p>ETA provides guidance on emerging technologies deployment across an enterprise or agency along with the best practices that ensure persistent energy and financial savings. Daryl and Lee worked with the Energy Management, Interior Design, Engineering teams of The VA Medical Center San Diego as well as US Army Corps of Engineer who managed the new construction projects for the Medical Center. Even though the teams opted against using new technologies due to the time constraints, the exposure to the latter was crucial for the hospital to achieve the high level of energy savings mandated by the Administration. Through the process, the Medical Center tested advanced lighting control technologies.</p>
    
    <h4>4. Innovation in Plug Load Control Strategies and Best Practices</h4>
    <p>ETA introduced new control strategies to the hospital including the use of individual workspace control in office spaces that integrates lighting and plug load control strategies. The brand new VA Oceanside Clinic, sister facility to the VA Medical Center San Diego, implemented the control systems enabling personal occupancy control for the medical staff. ETA worked with the Interior Design, Energy Management, Project Management and Engineering teams.</p>
    
    <h3 class="th3 blue">The VA Oceanside Project:</h3>
    <p>For further details, please click  on <a href="http://www.sandiego.va.gov/visitors/oceanside.asp" target="_blank">VA Oceanside Clinic</a>.</p>
    <p>The Clinic is part of the VA San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS). It opened on July 23, 2010 at a ribbon-cutting ceremony.</p>
    <p>In 2009, VASDHS  delivered more than 54,400 outpatient clinic visits in the Vista and Escondido clinics, experiencing significant growth in demand for health care services for Veterans in North County, due to its proximity to Camp Pendleton Marine Base. VASDHS has enrolled more than 25,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans since 2003.</p>
    <p>Services offered at the new Oceanside Clinic include primary care, mental health, compensation and pension physicals, diabetes, dermatology, laboratory, nutrition, optometry, prosthetics, social work, physical therapy, and radiology.  Dental, women Veteran's health and traumatic brain injury care will be added within the next few months. The two-story 65,465 square-foot clinic will provide services for up to 88,000 outpatient visits per year. “This clinic is conveniently located and significantly expands our services for North County Veterans,” said Stan Johnson, director of the VA San Diego Healthcare System.</p>

    <h3 class="th3 red">B. Strategic Planning and Evaluation of Energy Efficiency Program</h3>
    <p>Provide Federal Agencies with the development of strategic plan and roll out of programs until completion, in strict adherence to the current mission each Department or Agency.</p>
    <p>Daryl DeJean was invited by the US Department of Energy in 2009 to participate in Solid State Lighting (SSL) program-wide peer review. The review entailed the DOE Strategic Plan for the Solid State Lighting Technology and recommendations for additional research and enhancements to the SSL program. Daryl was one of five peer reviewers selected by the DOE nationally to help it look at the program from a practical business viewpoint and ensure that the program delivers the the best technologies for the markeplace in the multi-year plan.</p>
    <p>The final report to the US Department of Energy is included in the Department's Multi Year Researd and Development Plan that can be view on the DOE website at the following link:</p>

The findings of the DOE internal peer review are described in detail in Section 6.1.2 of the Plan page 119.</p>
    <p>Daryl continues to participate as a volunteer in the quarterly lighting conference calls coordinated by the US DOE as part of the continuing check and balance and request for market feedback that the Program Manager is eeking from the private sector. He is also involved in the Statewide Quarterly Lighting meetings that all of the utilities participate in. His views represents the voice of the end-user specifically the Facilities Management , Engineering, Design and Energy Management teams of both public and private sector buildings.</p>
    
    <h3 class="th3 red">C. Technical Consultancy for Emerging Technologies</h3>
    <p>Assessment of energy efficiency needs and locate proper solution. Provide Federal Agencies with the tools and knowledge to make the right purchasing decisions on emerging technologies and existing technologies whether lighting, HVAC or building envelope.</p>
    
    <h4>1. Food and Drug Administration Building</h4>
    <p>In Summer, 2010, providing consultancy and review of LED parking structure lmuinaires project.</p>
    
    <h4>2. US Department of Energy Headquarters Project</h4>
    <p>In December, 2010, the U.S. Department of Energy Headquarters portico is now retrofitted with high performance LEDs meeting the exact specifications of the DOE Facilities team and Noresco.</p>
    <p>The LEDs have to provide sufficient illumination to light up an area about 20 feet below the building. The challenge was to locate a manufacturer willing to meet the challenging specifications of the project manager. The project took two years to complete.</p>
