    <h1 class="th1">California Advanced Lighting Controls Training Program (CALCTP)</h1>
	<div class="row">
	<p>In June 2008. Emerging Technologies Associates (ETA) was retained by Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric, the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA), the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and the California Community College System to create part of the Business Section for a new statewide training program on Advanced Lighting Control Systems.</p>
    <p>The training initiative was named California Advanced Lighting Controls Program (CALCTP). This course is part of a statewide workforce development initiative to create a certfication process that will ensure persistent energy savings as a result of the proper installation and commissioning of advanced lighting control systems.</p>
    <p>For more details on the goals of the CALCTP for the State of California, you can click on the following link:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.calctp.org/" target="_blank">CALCTP website</a></p>
    <p>Emerging Technologies Associates (ETA) and Kingport Corporation created the Market Drivers and Financing Projects modules for the course and conducted the initial four Train the Trainer sessions for selected participants of the program. In addition, Emerging Technologies Associates screened and selected financial institutions and other financial service providers for the initiative to finance energy efficiency projects resulting from the CALCTP Initiative.</p>
    <p>The CALCTP Training Program is being taught throughout the state of California at many IBEW-NECA Training Centers. Please refer to our Seminar Pages for Upcoming Training Sessions.</p>
    <p>In  July and August 2010, ETA taught 30 NECA and IBEW members during two seminars in Northern California under the sponsorship of IBEW-NECA Central Coast and Northern California Chapters. Several contractors immediately put the seminar material to use.</p>
    <p>Emerging Technologies Associates was retained in the Fall of 2011 to conduct a California statewide marketing and education outreach for the CALCTP Program. The outreach project is to be completed on July 1, 2012.</p>
    <p>We have just completed another successful all day CALCTP seminar. This is the first CALCTP Business seminar conducted in Orange County.</p>

    <h2 class="th2">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009: Energy Training Partnership Grants</h2>
    <h3 class="th3">Recovery Act: Competitive Grants for Green Job Training</h3>
    <p>On February 17, 2009, President Barack Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) to preserve and create jobs, promote the nation's economic recovery, and assist those most impacted by the recession. The purpose of these grants is to teach workers the skills required in emerging industries including energy efficiency and renewable energy.</p>
    <h3 class="th3">Energy Training Partnership Grants Overview</h3>
    <p>The Energy Training Partnership grant program will provide training for workers that prepares them to enter the energy efficiency and renewable energy industries, as well as green occupations within other industries. These grants invest in partnerships made up of diverse set of stakeholders including labor organizations, public or private employers in the energy efficiency and renewable energy industries, and the workforce system. Bringing together the workforce expertise of these groups will allow grantees to develop programs that are responsive to the needs of both workers and employers, and that provide participants with the support needed to successfully complete training. The grantees will utilize these partnerships to design and distribute training approaches that lead to portable industry credentials and employment, including registered apprenticeship. The Department of Labor awarded grants to workforce development projects that focused on connecting target populations to career pathways in green industries. The Department also was interested in projects that contributed to our understanding of green industries and jobs that clean and enhance our environment.</p>
    <p>These investments are designed to achieve the following goals:</p>
    <ul class="ullist">
    <li>Provide training and placement services in the energy efficiency and renewable energy industries for workers impacted by national energy and environmental policy, individuals in need of updated training related to the energy efficiency and renewable energy industries, and unemployed workers.</li>
    <li>All training and placement activities funded through this grant program will be conducted at the local level.</li>
    <li>A portion of the total funds—approximately $25 million—are reserved for projects that will serve communities impacted by automotive industryrelated restructuring.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="th3">Grantee Summaries</h3>
    <p>Twenty-five (25) awards ranging from approximately $1.4 million to $5 million each were made to private nonprofit organizations that applied under one of two categories:</p>
