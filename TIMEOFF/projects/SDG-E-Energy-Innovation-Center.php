	<p>Daryl DeJean began in the first quarter of 2011 working on the lighting of the San Diego Gas & Electric Energy Innovation Center. Daryl working in close coordination with many lighting fixture and lightin control systems manufacturers, assisted the architect, engineering and construction is the selection of the state of the art lighting solutions and integrating the lighting system with other building systems. In addition, extensive use of daylighting will demonstrate the costs effectiveness of daylighting.</p>
    <p>At the Center, leading-edge technologies will be exhibited for commercial and industry professionals to evaluate and incorporate into their own building designs and plans.</p>
    <p>SDG&E will hold seminars and demonstrations to help customers find the most cost-effective and energy-efficient solutions to meet their specific needs.</p>
