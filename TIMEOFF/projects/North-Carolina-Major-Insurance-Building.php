	<p>A national insurance company retained Emerging Technologies Associates in 2008  to provide technical expertise and select the best  LED solutions for their building portico lighting replacing inefficient and high maintenance fluorescent lighting. This project demonstrates that LED have a place in exterior lighting when properly the lighting retrofit is properly planned taking into account occupants needs as a top priority balancing design, energy efficiency and cost leading to the client 's acceptance of the recommended LED lamp solution.</p>
    <p>This is one of the first successful LED retrofit buildings in the country for downlight applications. To date, the  lamps continue to perform to the level of expectation of the project sponsor. Not one lamp has failed.  The building owner was able to get better color rendering and the exact level of brightness that he was aiming for.</p>
