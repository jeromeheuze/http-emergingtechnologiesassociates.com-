	<p>Travelers  was seeking to save energy in its training center, Claim University. The  200,000 square foot Windsor,CT based- training center had hi bay lighting in several large training laboratories. ETA was retained to seek high effciency lighting technologirs that would deliver the output and color temperature that the interior design specified for the building. ETA presented many new lighting technologies including HID to meet the occupants needs and the design team's requirements.</p>
    <p>In addition, the Facility Manager for the building was concerned that lights were left on too often and was looking for a way to reduce energy waste when the lights were not in use.</p>
    <p>The design included control strategies to accomodate the occupancy pattern of the occupants and minimize wasted hi bay light fixtures left on all day and until late at night. An energy model was created based on the strategies.</p>
