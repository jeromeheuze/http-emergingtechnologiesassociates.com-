	<p>Retained by Dennis Morin, Training Executive Director of the Sacramento Area Electrical Training Center to validate the energy management plan, strategies and implementation of the Center, Emerging Technologies Associates for whom Lee Stevens sub-contracted her consult services , successfully benchmarked and assisted the Center owners, IBEW Local 340, in obtaining the ENERGY STAR for the building which was one of the first training for the nationally acclaimed California Advanced Lighting Control Program (CALCTP).</p>
    <p>The benchmarking is the first step in the ENERGY STAR  program and energy management plan created by Dennis Morin and Rick Garbrick, Marketing Director, Schetter Electric (Center’s lighting and solar contractor); the Center is using the staged approach to energy management to successfully implement further energy usage reductions.</p>
    <p>Dennis Morin, formerly with Bank of America Human Resources Department, has been involved in the implementation of the many Apprenticeship and Journeyman Training Programs: CALCTP, Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program (EVITP), Solar Training Program etc. For the last year and a  half,  Dennis has been  working with all occupants in the building on reducing energy consumption with behavioral changes and some occupancy sensors installed spaces that are used infrequently. In addition, operations and maintenance procedures are continually tuned up.</p>
	<p>In consultation with Lee Stevens and Rick Garbrick, Dennis Morin is planning the next phase of the energy management of the Training Center: various systems lighting and lighting control systems have been proposed by Schetter Electric to the owner of the building, IBEW Local 340, in accordance with the electric firm’s total clean energy assessment.</p>
