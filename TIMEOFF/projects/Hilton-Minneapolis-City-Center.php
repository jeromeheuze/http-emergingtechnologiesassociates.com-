	<p>in 2007, prior to joining Emerging Technologies Associates, Lee Stevens was involved in a test site of an innovative energy efficiency emerging technology introduction to the hospitality industry.</p>
    <p>Lee and colleagues worked with the Hilton Hotels team assessing the use of Ozone to reduce the consumption of hot water in hotel laundry system with an energy service company. The site selected was Hilton, Minneapolis City Center, Minneapolis, MN. The project was completed and natural gas, water as well as electric savings were recorded.
