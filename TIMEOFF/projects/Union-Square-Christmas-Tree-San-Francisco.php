	<p>In 2007, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) was contacted by one of the project sponsors of the Union Square Christmas Tree regarding energy efficient lighting options available to replace the 20,000 incandescent lights adorning the 85-foot Christmas Tree. The tree was to be lit on November 23, 2007 at the annual lighting fund raising event.</p>
    <p>Daryl DeJean, an independent contractor for PG&E, was assigned to evaluate and locate the best LED lamps on the market for the replacement of the less efficient incandescent lamps. Based on the recommendations of Mr. DeJean, the project sponsor saved an estimated 50% in electric energy on the lighting of the Christmas Tree throughout the Holiday Season.</p>

    <p>The lamp replacement project was part of a fund raising campaign benefiting the UCSF Children's Hospital as the public was asked to donate $10 a bulb. Learn more about this <a href="http://www.ucsfbenioffchildrens.org/tree/index.html" target="_blank">fund raiser</a>.</p>
