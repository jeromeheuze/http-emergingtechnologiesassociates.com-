	<p>ETA introduced to Travelers 's Hartford Facility Management team in 2009 the entire ENERGY STAR Energy Management program. Many training sessions were conducted on site. As a result of ETA's help, Travelers received three additional ENERGY STAR labels in 2009.</p>   
    <p>The following projects were started in 2009 and are ongoing:</p>
    <ol class="ollist">
    <li>training of Facility Managers team about the ENERGY STAR energy management program1. four office buildings in Massachussetts and Connecticut were benchmarked and their energy performances were tracked.</li>
    <li>benchmarking of three buildings resulted in Travelers receiving three ENERGY STAR labels in 2009;</li>
    <li>multiple strategic alternatives for reduction energy consumption as well as greenhouse gases were developed for Travelers;</li>
    <li>fourty energy efficiency measures were recommended to Travelers for implementation in one location</li>
    <li>design specific life cycle costing tools and methodology to allow Travellers to evaluate all energy efficiency measures whether HVAC, lighting or plug load.</li>
