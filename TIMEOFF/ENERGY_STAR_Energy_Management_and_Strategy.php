    <p>ENERGY STAR Professional (P.E.) Certification</p>
    <p>Emerging Technologies Associates assisted Travelers in benchmarking three  office buildings  in CT and MA with over 2,000,000 square feet of space starting April 2009. When it was confirmed that the building qualified for an ENERGY STAR Rating and Label, Mark Gendron, Professional Engineer, reviewed the building's building plans and inspected the building's HVAC, lighting system, plug load and air quality to certify the building for ENERGY STAR. In  2009, the buildings received an ENERGY STAR label. Even after achieving a high rating, Travelers undertook additional projects to obtain additional energy savings in the building. Emerging Technologies Associates, Inc. worked on a lighting control system and high efficiency lighting for the client that allowed them to better use their high efficiency fixtures which hetetofore could not be dimmed or turned off except manually. 400 Watts lamps were left on in broad daylight and at night when no one was in the building.</p>
