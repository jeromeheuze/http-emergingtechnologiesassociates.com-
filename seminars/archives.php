                        Protection Agency - May 14, 2012</h3>

                    <p>The Power Point Presentation and below the link to the national webinar that we worked
                        with San Diego State University and US EPA ENERGY STAR.</p>

                    <p>The energy management strategy, plan, goals and implementation that college students
                        learned in less than 5 months in the ENERGY STAR Course has shaped many sectors of the
                        US economy and many California businesses. This is a vital workforce education free
                        resource available to the entire State of California.</p>

                    <p>ENERGY STAR for Buildings &amp; Plants is a successful, strategic and scalable workforce
                        training program.
                        Market Transformation only occurs with educated stakeholders who are on the same page.
                        The implementation of the State ' Strategic Energy Plan can be facilitated with the a
                        unifying energy management plan that all can understand and where results can be
                        measured and evaluated against Targeted Goals. That is what ENERGY STAR is all about !
                        The students GOT IT!</p>

                    <p>ENERGY STAR Higher Education Spring Networking Webcast, featuring Daryl DeJean and his
                        students in the ENERGY STAR course currently being taught at San Diego State University,
                        CA. We hope you found this session informative, and have attached the slides for your
                        reference.</p>

                <p>The seminar had a record attendance of 23 . Many experts in lighting control projects shared their success stories with others!</p>
<p>Energized and connecting with each other, most attendees stayed until the very end and beyond until 5pm.</p>
<p>Several seasoned contractors came to hear us validate their approach to the market.</p>
<p>The interaction between all attendees was very of the highest level and many volunteered information willingly as we shared so many new tools and previews of market drivers to come. An SCE Lighting Program guest helped us engage and drive the reality of what is going on statewide with the lighting control market, emphasizing the need for contractors to continually stay updated through Edison's educational programs.</p>
<p>As a result, there was a tremendous amount of interest in the Lighting Academy and your other seminars at EEC. We connected the dots by stressing that this seminar must followed up by attending CAA as well as EEC seminars.</p>

                <p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
                <p>150 attended the seminar  that has the best attendance to date for ETA's West Coast seminars. It still does not top the 200 plus seminar conducted in CT two years ago. The high attendance is testimonial to the crucial importance of keeping any educational initiative concise, to the point and highly participatory. The attendees included high level executives already working on lighting projects in various stages. The latter were highly engaged in the continuous dialogue that Daryl was hoping would occur. The tremendous knowledge of the audience made for a super knowledge transfer among all attendees. Thank you SDG&E for hosting this successful seminar.</p>

                <p>Daryl DeJean will  blend his experience as Director of Facilities for HILTI  managing 200 facilities throughout North America with the ENERGY STAR program. He will draw on his experience with diverse facilities (plants, distribution centers, climates zones, call center, corporate headquarters, multi-functional teams and multiple building systems)  to highlight the most successful features of the ENERGY STAR energy management five stage approach. He will review key sections of the Building Upgrade Manual and allow the attendees to select the measures that best suits the NEEDS of the owners, occupants or managers of the buildings.</p>
                <p>His practitioner view point combined with ENERGY STAR well documented case studies will allow you to confidently state your case to your management to justify request funding  under your capital /operating budget for more energy efficiency projects, help you make credible presentation to the C suite or the Board of Directors and most importantly, develop a multi-year strategic plan and energy management program that delivers energy savings results, and most importantly financial results.</p>
                <p>He will tie the recommendations of the Building Upgrade Manual with  the LEED Certification and obtaining a ENERGY STAR label. He will also share his assessments of emerging technologies (not to be confused with new technologies) already in use in the marketplace to achieve persistent and higher savings quickly. He will share lessons learned from his clients and resources for validation of energy savings from important national websites. </p>

                <h3>ENERGY STAR Building Upgrade Manual Part 1 Seminar - January 12, 2011</h3>
                <p>What projects should you consider first to improve your energy performance? Learn prioritization, strategy development, cost justification and proven step-by-step project management of energy efficient projects.</p>
                <p>Daryl DeJean will  blend his experience as Director of Facilities for HILTI  managing 200 facilities throughout North America with the ENERGY STAR program. He will draw on his experience with diverse facilities (plants, distribution centers, climates zones, call center, corporate headquarters, multi functional teams and multiple building systems)  to highlight the most successful features of the ENERGY STAR energy management five stage approach. You will  review key sections of the Building Upgrade Manual and learn to  select the measures that best suits the NEEDS of the owners, occupants or managers of the buildings in a well prioritized plan.</p>
                <p>In Part 1, Daryl will review how benchmarking in Portfolio Manager allows a project manager to track an energy efficiency project from beginning to end. He will introduce Target Finder a tool that will allow you to run some sensitivity analyses to compare the energy savings between projects.</p>
                <p>You  will use  the Cash Flow Opportunity Calculator to determine the cash flow of  each project under evaluation and  prioritize them on a timeline or to meet budget.</p>
                <p>You will learn the Building Upgrade Value Calculator that will provide total transparency to the the value of your projects to the owners of your facilities. The Building Upgrade Value Calculator, developed by the U.S. EPA, is a product of the partnership between ENERGY STAR, BOMA International, and the BOMA Foundation. This calculator was developed as part of BOMA’s Energy Efficiency Program (BEEP), a series of courses designed to help commercial real estate practitioners improve their buildings’ energy efficiency performance. The calculator tool was developed to help property professionals assess the financial value of investments in a property’s energy performance and is part of the BEEP course 5 Valuing Energy Enhancement Projects & Financial Returns.</p>
                <p>Daryl 's practitioner view point combined with ENERGY STAR's well documented case studies will allow you to state your case with confidence to your management to request funding  under your capital /operating budget for energy efficiency projects, help you make credible presentation to the C suite or the Board of Directors and most importantly, develop a multi-year strategic plan and energy management program that delivers energy savings results, and most importantly financial results.</p>
                <p>Daryl will also demonstrate how cash flow can be derived from well executed projects that will necessitate very little financing . He will also review how the use of  utility incentives, On Bill Financing as well as tax incentives can help you get projects through top management.  Finally, he will touch on the currently available financing vehicles to minimize the cash flow impact.</p>
                <p>Most importantly, he will share with you lessons learned by himself and many others on how to be embrace energy efficiency while meeting corporate goals and the vision of your company or organization.</p>
